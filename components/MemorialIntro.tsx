          <p>
            As we remember and celebrate the life of our beloved Wife, Mother, Sister and Friend,
            we wish to share that the arrangements for her funeral will be guided entirely by her own
            clear and heartfelt instructions. In her final wishes, Adobea expressed a strong desire for
            a simple, quiet farewell. She intends that we focus not on ceremony, but on reflection,
            gratitude, and love. Out of deep respect for her values and intentions, our family is
            honouring her request by keeping the proceedings modest and sincere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Per her wishes, there will be a private burial, no one week observation, no wake keeping,
            no laying in state, no wreaths and no other funeral rites. Thank you for joining us in
            honouring her in the way she wished to be rememberedâ€”with simplicity, dignity, and
            peace.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.signature}>With love, the Family.</p>
